			'<p>First and foremost, TypeScript puts the super in superset, especially in a team environment. State management in React can be cumbersome, which is why I consider GraphQL and Apollo to be the dynamic duo. That said, Redux and Recoil each have their use-cases as well.</p><p>As far as primary prebuilts are concerened, the "Next.js" framework is top-notch. It removes the otherwise tedious process of manually configuring Webpack to support a server-side rendering app from the equation. It saves time, simplifies optimization, and delivers blazing fast performance to ultimately enhance end-user experience.</p><p> "The mechanic that would perfect his work must first sharpen his tools." - <em>Confucius</em></p><br />'

My career as a director of market research inspired me to pursue my true passion of creating web applications. I love being creative and unique, but I also appreciate the technical challenges of back-end development. When programming I follow structure and order, since this is essential when creating quality web applications. I enjoy debugging and critiquing small details, as well as optimizing applications. Working in a team setting is ideal, because more knowledge is obtained and retained between developers.</p>"
